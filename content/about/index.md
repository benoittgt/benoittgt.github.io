# About Me

Software Engineer since 10 years. I contributed to Ruby, Rails and I was member of the RSpec core team. I work essentially with Ruby and SQL but on various other languages and tech stacks.

Here are a few things:

- [I built an analytics pipeline on AWS with Lambdas, Firehose, Redshift and RDS](https://medium.com/appaloosa-store-engineering/from-mongodb-to-aws-redshift-a-practical-guide-5ec8ee8fb147)
- [Passionate about performance on Ruby applications and Ruby On Rails app](https://medium.com/appaloosa-store-engineering/ruby-memory-activerecord-and-draper-64f06abeeb34w)
- Good knowledge of open source. I contributed to Ruby, Ruby and Rails, and I was part of the RSpec core team between 2018 and 2021.
- I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set.
- Passionate about internals of projects (Ruby, PostgreSQL, etc). I wrote a wiki to dig into a few of [Ruby memory internals](https://github.com/benoittgt/understand_ruby_memory/wiki) for example.
