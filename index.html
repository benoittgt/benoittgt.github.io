          <p>Software Engineer since 6 years. I contributed to Ruby, Rails and I am member of the RSpec core team. I work essentially with Ruby and SQL. I have knowledge in Javascript, Go and Elixir.</p>

            <li>Passionate about internals of project (Ruby, PostgreSQL, etc). I wrote a wiki to dig into few of <a href="https://github.com/benoittgt/understand_ruby_memory/wiki">Ruby memory internal</a> for example.</li>
            <li>Good communication skills with coworkers and customers. Since I started programming I was always convinced that we should use the product we build like our customers do. Gather feedbacks, iterate, deploy very often, monitor properly, scale.</li>
